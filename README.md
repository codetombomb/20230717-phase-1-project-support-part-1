## What is Bootstrap?

Bootstrap is a set of tools that helps make websites look good and work well on different devices without writing CSS. It provides ready-made styles, making it easier for us to create attractive and user-friendly websites without starting from scratch.

In a nutshell, Bootstrap is a way for us to style our apps without writing our own CSS.

- Bootstrap was created to [solve a problem](https://blog.twitter.com/developer/en_us/a/2011/bootstrap-twitter#:~:text=In%20the%20earlier%20days%20of%20Twitter%2C%20engineers%20used%20almost%20any%20library%20they%20were%20familiar%20with%20to%20meet%20front%2Dend%20requirements.%20Inconsistencies%20among%20the%20individual%20applications%20made%20it%20difficult%20to%20scale%20and%20maintain%20them.):

    - Early on at Twitter, many *different* front-end libraries were used to create the user interfaces which led to inconsistencies and made it difficult to keep everything up-to-date.
- In 2010, during Twitter’s first-ever employee [Hack Week](https://blog.twitter.com/engineering/en_us/a/2010/hack-week) (October 22 - 29), Bootstrap (then called Twitter Blueprint) was quickly developed, by many Twitter employees, into a deployable solution to their front-end problem.
- Almost a year later, on Friday, August 19, 2011, Bootstrap was released to the public and since has had over 20 releases including two major re-writes in versions 2 and 3.
